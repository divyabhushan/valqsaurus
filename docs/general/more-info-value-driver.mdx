If you click on a node Widget, a Pop up screen is displayed with
additional information on the selected node.

For some nodes, the designer may have added a description beyond the
title. If so, this will be displayed below the title.

If a node is calculated, a simplified version of the formula is
displayed. This is the technical formula that is used to calculate
individual period values. To calculate the real values, all simulation
variations that affects the node are applied to selected and future
periods and the aggregation rules for the node is applied (sum or
weighted average).

The trend chart compares the simulated value to the comparison version
as well as showing the original value as the dotted line on the bar if
simulation variations are active. If you hover over the bar, you will
the see the details for the period.

The table on the top right shows the period and full year values and the
variance calculations as per the definition previously in this document.

The ValQ visual also analyses all the active simulations to see
if any impacts this particular node. If so, it then analyses how much
each of the active simulation changes contributes to the overall impact
on this node and generates a waterfall diagram with the break down which
is displayed in the bottom right panel.

In some scenarios, you may vary multiple factors impacting the same node
in a compound nature. I.e. you vary both sales volume and sales price
and want to know the impact on revenue. As the sum of both changes is
more than the impact of each individually, the waterfall chart breaks
down each of the individual impacts and a compound impact bar.

As part of the latest Release, you will be able to view the Value
Display Tooltip by hovering the mouse over the Trend Chart Area in the
Pop up screen (see Figure below). Also you can view the data labels for
the X Axis. The values representing the loss status will be in Red color
and the values representing the gain status will be in Green color as
shown in the below Figure.
