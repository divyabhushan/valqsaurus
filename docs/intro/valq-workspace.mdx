1. A ValQ workspace or account is provisioned when a customer purchases a ValQ collaborate product. The customer can select the number of users to be added to the workspace/account and the plan at the time of purchase.
1. Only registered users in the workspace will be able to login to the ValQ visual (via Office365 login).
1. The collaboration features - storage, commenting, exporting data source, model merge, and user security etc. will be enabled for the users of the workspace.
