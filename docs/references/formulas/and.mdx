---
An `AND` statement returns TRUE only if **all** the arguments are TRUE and returns FALSE if any of the arguments is FALSE. 

## Syntax
```javascript
AND ( logical_test1, [logical_test2], ... )
```
## Arguments
`logical_test1` – The first condition to be evaluated. This is a required argument.

`logical_test2, …`  – The additional conditions to be evaluated. These are optional arguments.

## Return value
Either True or False.

## Remarks
The `AND` function accepts multiple conditions.

## Example
Consider a scenario in which if the number of licenses is greater than 500 and usage period is greater than 24 months, 
then the price should be $20 else $25.

To achieve this, the formula should be
```javascript
IF(AND(Num_of_Licenses>500,Duration<24),20,25)
```
