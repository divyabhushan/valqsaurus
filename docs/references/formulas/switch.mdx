title: SWITCH
---

A `SWITCH` statement evaluates an expression against a list of values and returns the result corresponding to the first matching value. 
If there is no match, an optional default value is returned.

## Syntax
```javascript
SWITCH ( expression, value1, result1, value2, result2, ... value_n, result_n, [default] )
```
## Arguments
`expression` – The statement to be evaluated.

`value1, value2, … value_n` – The list of values to be compared against the expression.

`result1, result2, … result_n` – The result to be returned if the expression matches with the corresponding value in the argument list.

`default` – The default value to be returned if the expression does not match with any of the values in the argument list. This is an optional argument.

## Return value
result when the expression matches with value, default in case there was no match.

## Remark
All result expressions and the else expression must be of the same data type.

## Example
Consider a scenario in which the node Discount Rate is to be calculated based on the current month. 
Months Jan, Aug, Nov and Dec should have 15% as discount rate whereas the remaining months should have 20%.

This can be achieved by using the `SWITCH` function in the following manner.

```javascript
SWITCH(CURRENT_PERIOD_INDEX,1,0.15,8,0.15,11,0.15,12,0.15,0.20)
```
The result of the above formula is shown below

| Month         | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Discount Rate | 15% | 20% | 20% | 20% | 20% | 20% | 20% | 15% | 20% | 20% | 15% | 15% |
